This assignment is about aggregation and class collaboration.
You will create several Classes that will be part of an overall class named InstrumentDisplay.  The classes are FuelGage, Odometer, MilesSinceLastGas, and CruisingRange. You Must program each class in its own source file.  The InstrumentDisplay must have the other classes as private field varaiables.
Your implementation should allow a user to input gallons to add to the fuel tank and miles to drive down the road.  Don't allow overfilling the tank.  Don't allow the user to drive on an empty tank.
The FuelGage should assume a 15 gallon tank of gasoline and an average consumption of 1 gallon every 28 miles. It should increment in 1 gallon steps when you "add gas to the tank".  It should decrement by 1 every 28 miles.  It should display its current value.
You should also have a display that shows how many miles traveled since you last added gasoline, MilesSinceLastGas, and a display for the estimated number of miles until you run out of gasoline, the CruisingRange.
The Odometer should keep track of total mileage from 0 to 999,999.  After that it turns over back to 0.  Make sure your code allows for this rollover.
The overall class is to be named InstrumentDisplay.  You may create the various outputs using System.out or JOptionPane.  Make sure that account for both filling and emptying the tank.  While your odometer will display in 1 mile increments, you should keep track of mileage internally in one tenth of a mile increments for purposes of computing gasoline remaining in the FuelGage and miles in the CruisingRange
Please make sure you comment your code thoroughly.
The code should be nicely formatted and should use proper variables.
You will post a link to your video  here.
The video  should have the following items:
1) You should start by showing the comments in your code that include your name, the class, and what the assignment is.
2) You should show all of your code. Slowly scroll through your code.
3) You must show your code compiling.
4) You must show your code running and completely test your program. If there are special inputs or outputs your program should check, please make sure you detail that your program can handle it.
5) If there is anything special you added to the program then please detail it.
6) Submit all source code files in addition to your  video link.
You only have 5 to 10 minutes in your screen cast so please make sure you are concise and you cover everything you need. You may have to practice your screen capturing a few times to get this right.
